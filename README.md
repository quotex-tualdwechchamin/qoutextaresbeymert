next trade. If you lose again, you would bet \$40 on your next trade,
and so on.

Fibonacci sequence.

With this strategy, you start with a small bet and gradually increase
your bet size as you win trades.

## The Risk and Reward Ratio

on the ratio of your potential profit to your potential loss.

With this strategy, you only take trades that have a risk and reward
ratio that is in your favor.
